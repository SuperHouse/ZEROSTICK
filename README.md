"ZeroStick" Zero-Deflection Assistive Technology Joystick
==========================================================

ZeroStick is a joystick that uses strain gauges to measure force
applied to it, without the joystick needing to move. The joystick
"position" is determined from the force being applied to it, instead of
any physical deflection of the stick.

The term "position" is used here to signify the virtual position of the
joystick, even though it doesn't physically move. As more force is
applied, the virtual position of the joystick is considered to change.

This allows it to be used by people with a limited range of motion,
such as from Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

The sensitivity of the joystick can be adjusted in software by changing
the scaling of the values detected by the strain gauges.

The position value is measured as % deflection from the zero (central)
position, ie: from -100% to +100%. This is equivalent to full effort by
the user in each direction.
